# 📈 Thesis Project – Sovereign Bond Comovement Analysis
This repository contains the Python code and data files used in my Master’s thesis, which focuses on the comovement of emerging market sovereign bonds. The analysis integrates macro factors, rolling correlations, PCA, and DCC models to identify common drivers and systemic risk in sovereign debt markets.

## 🗂️ Contents
Tesis.py: Main Python script containing data preparation, correlation analysis, PCA, clustering, and DCC modeling.

Bonos VF.xlsx: Excel file with sovereign bond data and external factors used in the analysis.

## 🔬 Key Features
Data Loading & Cleaning: Imports and cleans historical sovereign bond prices and external factor indices.

Rolling Correlations: Calculates and visualizes rolling average correlations across countries.

Adjusted Correlations: Uses external factors for regression-based adjustment of correlations.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Identifies major drivers of bond returns and clusters countries by loadings.

Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) Model: Estimates time-varying correlations and systemic risk indicators.

## 🏆 Purpose
This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis in Quantitative Finance at UTDT, focusing on Emerging Markets fixed income and systemic risk modeling.
