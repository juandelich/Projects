ðŸ“ˆ Projects Repository
Welcome to my Projects Repository, where I showcase a selection of quantitative finance models, trade strategy frameworks, and econometric tools developed over the course of my career as an Emerging Markets Analyst. These projects highlight my proficiency in Python, asset pricing, macroeconomic forecasting, and quantitative research, with a particular focus on LATAM economies and sovereign debt markets.

Each project is designed to reflect my commitment to combining rigorous financial analysis, practical implementation, and global perspectives to inform investment decisions and generate actionable trade ideas. This repository serves as a professional reference to demonstrate my technical capabilities and approach to solving complex financial problems.
